# API-Cryptocurrencies
This project was developed with the idea of becoming familiar with APIs, for which Kraken was used as it provides us with updated information on the value of any pair of cryptocurrencies.
The project consists of plotting the price of a pair of currencies of our choice and also being able to represent a widely used indicator in this type of work such as the stochastic oscillator.
To represent the price we have made use of the candlestick chart, which is used to visually and in detail give information about the market prices of an asset, allowing to recognise patterns and trends as well as to perform technical analysis to help in trading strategies.
